###  LMTP

**LMTP (Local Mail Transfer Protocol)** is used in our project for **delivering emails from Postfix to Dovecot**. Specifically, when an email arrives at our server, **Postfix** receives it first. Instead of Postfix storing the email directly, it uses **LMTP** to hand over the email to **Dovecot**, which then stores it in the appropriate mailbox directory.

In this project, LMTP helps ensure seamless integration between **Postfix** (the component that handles email routing and receipt) and **Dovecot** (the component that manages email storage and user access via IMAP or POP3). This setup is crucial for maintaining **clean separation** between the tasks of receiving, routing, and storing emails, making the email system more modular and manageable.


#### **Install Dovecot LMTP Package**
   - It appears that **LMTP** support is not currently installed. You need to install the `dovecot-lmtpd` package.
   - Run the following command to install LMTP:
     ```bash
     sudo apt-get install dovecot-lmtpd
     ```
   - After installing this package, it should provide the necessary LMTP binaries that Dovecot is looking for.

#### **Check Dovecot Configuration for LMTP Path**
   - Make sure your Dovecot LMTP configuration (`/etc/dovecot/conf.d/10-master.conf`) is pointing to the correct path for the LMTP service.
   - The typical configuration for the LMTP socket should be:
     ```bash
     service lmtp {
       unix_listener /var/spool/postfix/private/dovecot-lmtp {
         mode = 0600
         user = postfix
         group = postfix
       }
     }
     ```
   - This configuration should be correct if **LMTP** is installed, and it tells Dovecot to create a **UNIX socket** that Postfix can use to deliver mail.

#### **Restart Dovecot After Fixing Installation**
   - Once you have installed the `dovecot-lmtpd` package, try **restarting Dovecot** to see if the issue is resolved:
     ```bash
     sudo systemctl restart dovecot
     ```
   - Then check the status to see if there are any errors:
     ```bash
     sudo systemctl status dovecot
     ```

#### **Verify LMTP Path (If Issue Persists)**
   - If the issue persists even after installing the `dovecot-lmtpd` package, you may need to verify the **location** of the LMTP binary.
   - You can use the `find` command to search for the LMTP executable:
     ```bash
     sudo find /usr/lib/dovecot/ -name lmtp
     ```
   - If the path differs from `/usr/lib/dovecot/lmtp`, update your configuration accordingly.
