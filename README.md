# freebus
 
The aim of this project is to define, specify, and code the FreeBus project using limited human resources and expertise. The specification and development are done with prompt engineering, based on ChatGPT and Canvas.


## OBJECTIVE:
The Citizen Bus project aims to address the mobility challenges faced by older individuals who may struggle to access essential services like bakeries, butchers, and supermarkets due to limited mobility or lack of transportation options. Our initiative offers a free bus service to anyone interested, regardless of age, with the option for passengers to make voluntary donations to support the service. To enhance accessibility and convenience, we are developing a mobile application that facilitates seat reservations for the Citizen Bus service.

The app will enable users to easily book seats on the Citizen Bus, providing a seamless and efficient way to secure transportation to their desired destinations. With intuitive features and a user-friendly interface, the app aims to empower individuals to independently arrange their travel plans, promoting autonomy and social inclusion among older citizens. By leveraging technology to support the Citizen Bus service, we strive to enhance mobility options for vulnerable populations and foster a sense of community support and connectivity.

## ARCHITECTURE:

 

- **Frontend**: The frontend will use Next.js 19 combined with React for creating an interactive and dynamic user experience. The user will access the application through the domain `nathabee.de/freebus`, served via Apache.
- **Backend**: The backend will leverage the server-side features of Next.js to communicate with the Django backend, which is hosted on the same server but not accessed directly from the frontend. This backend setup is located in the cloud, running on an Ubuntu environment.
- **Database**: The backend will also integrate with a MySQL (MariaDB) database, which stores user information, reservations, and other relevant data.
- **Server & Domain**: The backend and frontend are hosted under the domain `nathabee.de`. The frontend is available at `nathabee.de/freebus`, while the backend remains internal.
- **Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)**: Jenkins will handle the CI/CD processes to ensure smooth deployments, testing, and updates.
- **Code Repository**: The source code for the entire project will be stored in the GitHub repository named `freebus`, which is associated with the `nathabee` user.

## REQUIREMENTS:

- **User Interface (UI)**: The application will provide a clean, intuitive UI to allow users of all ages to easily navigate, make seat reservations, and view trip details.
- **Accessibility**: Designed to comply with WCAG standards to ensure older individuals can comfortably use the app. Features include larger buttons, clear labels, voice compatibility, and high-contrast mode.
- **Login & Registration**: Users will be able to register and log in using a simple authentication system. Passwords will be securely stored, and users can reset passwords as needed.
- **Reservation System**: Users will have access to a calendar-based reservation system to view available seats and make bookings. The system will show real-time seat availability.
- **Notifications**: The frontend will integrate notifications to inform users about reservation status, cancellations, or reminders for upcoming trips.
- **Performance Optimization**: The frontend will utilize code-splitting, lazy loading, and caching to improve performance, ensuring that even older devices can run the application smoothly.
- **Multi-Language Support**: The interface will be multilingual, supporting multiple languages to cater to diverse communities.
- **Error Handling**: User-friendly error messages will guide users in case of invalid inputs or other issues, improving the overall user experience.


  

## USER INTERFACE Specification

- **Menu Navigation**: The main menu will include options such as `Home`, `Reservation`, `Ticket History`, `User Dashboard`, and `Admin Tools`. The visibility of these options will be role-dependent.

  - **Overview** view of the FreeBus services and announcements.

## MODELE:


### User Model:
 

The **User Model** will be implemented as a **custom user model** in Django to allow flexibility for storing additional user data beyond the standard fields. This will include:

- **Fields**:

  - `username`: The user's unique identifier.
  - `email`: A required field for registration and communication.
  - `password`: Stored securely using Django's built-in hashing mechanism.
  - `first_name` and `last_name`: Personal information to address users.
  - `age`: To prioritize users and analyze usage.
  - `city_of_residence`: To ensure eligibility for service access (e.g., validation for specific cities).
  - `is_verified`: Boolean flag for administrative approval, ensuring that the user resides within the supported regions.

## Workflow Overview:

### User Registration and Authentication:
- **Authentication** ensures secure access to the booking system.
- **Django JWT** is used for the authentication process.
- **Roles** are assigned within the Django admin console. A user can have one of three roles: **supervisor**, **administrator**, or **booking privilege**.
- Any user can **register for an account**, which initially puts them in a **pending mode** that does not grant booking privileges. The user must fill out a form during registration.
- In Django, we use a **custom user model** to store user contact data, including address, telephone, age, disability flag, and disability description.
- **Supervisors** validate user data. They can also modify user details or create new users.

### Route Management:
- The **Route Model** defines the list of different activities (e.g., trips to city X, supermarket, Christmas Market, etc.). Each route is linked to a maximum number of places on the bus.
- There are also restrictions on the number of **rolators** or **wheelchairs** that can be transported per route.

### Calendar Management:
- The **Calendar Model** defines which routes are planned for which day.
- Routes can be scheduled for **weekly** or **monthly** trips. Each calendar entry is linked to a specific route and contains information on the number of available seats.
- The calendar is also linked to **booking entries**, allowing users to reserve seats for a specific route and date.

### Booking Process:
- Users access the **booking page** to select a route and a date from the calendar.
- Users confirm their selection to finalize the booking.

### Ticket Generation:
- Upon successful booking, users receive a **digital ticket** with journey details and seat information.
- Tickets can be viewed in the **ticket history** menu.

### User Dashboard:
- Users have access to a **dashboard** where they can manage bookings, view past trips, and update personal information.

### Admin Management:
- **Admins** oversee the entire system, managing bus routes, the calendar, seat availability, user accounts, and roles.

### Supervision Management:
- **Supervisors** oversee the booking system, verify booked routes, manage routes and calendar entries, and oversee user personal information.
